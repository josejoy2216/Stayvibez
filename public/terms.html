This Security Deposit amount shall be used to cover up any loss or damages caused to Property including but not limited to damages caused by pets, due to any cleaning required on demand of Guests, resetting of furniture, extra service calls beyond duty timings etc. by Guests. The Guests shall be responsible to check and report any damage to Property or its equipment, appliances, cutlery, crockery, utensils, furniture, fittings, furnishing, finishing, structure, etc. therein within 90 minutes of Check-In. If the Client fails to report any of the damages after such specified time period, such damage shall be deemed to have occurred during stay of the Guests and Guests shall be held responsible for such damages and resulting charges thereof. Guests shall be responsible to reimburse to Stay Vibez for any such damage / breakage caused by Guests to the Property or any of things attached to it such as equipments, appliances, cutlery, crockery, utensils, furniture, fittings, furnishing, finishing, structure, etc. during their stay without demure.</p>

Without prior consent of Stay Vibez Guests shall not move or relocate any equipment, appliances, furniture, fittings, furnishing, finishing and artifacts etc. from their original location except for chairs, other furniture like cane / plastic furniture etc. Any act of such nature may result in forfeiture of total Security Deposit without recourse.</p>
        <p>The Guests understands and agrees that Stay Vibez cannot immediately inspect Property at the Check-Out time of the Guests as there may be multiple rooms and facilities to be inspected and the same cannot be inspected for damages in such short time. The inspection for damages shall be done by Stay Vibez in the intervening time between Client’s Check-Out and next Check-In. Thus, refunding of Security Deposit after adjusting any recoverable, if any, cannot be done immediately on Check-Out and refunds against Security Deposit cannot be made at the time of Check-Out. Stay Vibez shall make an effort to refund the balance Security Advance as soon as possible, subject to maximum of 30 days from date of Check-Out.
